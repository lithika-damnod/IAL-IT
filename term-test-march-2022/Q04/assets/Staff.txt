Our staff pride themselves on being friendly and efficient. What they do not know about sailboats is not worth knowing. If you know exactly what you want, then they will have you booked up in the blink of an eye. If you do not know what you want, then they are experts at matching you to the sailboat that is most suitable for you. If you would also like an itinerary, then they are well-trained in creating a bespoke itinerary just for you. The itinerary can include quiet islands, busy resorts, or a mixture of both. Whatever you fancy, our staff can create for you. Our staff can match you with a captain if you want to have total relaxation. You can relax whilst the captain takes you to the most beautiful of places.
