                        The things in the world that I love most include whales, safaris, the Arctic, snow, scuba diving, bungee jumping, street food, guacamole, when my backpack comes out first on the baggage carousel, not getting sunburnt and travelling independently.
In just a few short months I have ‘crossed’ so many things off of my bucket list – and amazingly, the list doesn’t end there.
In the 4th grade my class spent a full term learning about ancient Egyptian civilisation. We made (faux) papyrus, used paper maché to make mummies and watched a whole bunch of docos all about this most famous time in Egypt’s history.
These documentaries all had one common and prominent feature.
They all featured the Pyramids of Giza.
Ever since then, visiting the Great Pyramids has been something on my bucket list, and I was lucky enough to ‘cross it off’ in early March, and it was everything I hoped it would be.
There are numerous ways to reach the Pyramids, and some are easier than others. Public buses and the metro are by far the cheapest options, but these are crowded and often uncomfortable. Alternatively, you could hire a private taxi or join a small group tour.

                        My name is Gira and I am a 25 from Australia. With a passion for exploring the planet, I spend half my life globe trotting. 
I started travelling independently at the age of 19 and in just 6 short years I have travelled across over 60 countries and all seven continents, but the more I see, the more I crave!
