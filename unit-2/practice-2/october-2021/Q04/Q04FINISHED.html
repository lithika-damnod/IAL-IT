                    <p>
                        Our staff pride themselves on being friendly and efficient. What they do not know about sailboats is not worth knowing. If you know exactly what you want, then they will have you booked up in the blink of an eye. If you do not know what you want, then they are experts at matching you to the sailboat that is most suitable for you. If you would also like an itinerary, then they are well-trained in creating a bespoke itinerary just for you. The itinerary can include quiet islands, busy resorts, or a mixture of both. Whatever you fancy, our staff can create for you. Our staff can match you with a captain if you want to have total relaxation. You can relax whilst the captain takes you to the most beautiful of places.

                        <p>
                            There are many quiet, private islands that we can arrange for you to visit. Here you can drop out of the world and simply watch time go by whilst relaxing on the beautiful, private golden beaches. Alternatively, you can go to a number of busy resorts. You can stay for as long as you want. Enjoy local cuisine and see life as it is. Many of our customers combine both. They spend days island hopping, some of them quiet some of them lively. They then spend days visiting some of the bustling resorts.
