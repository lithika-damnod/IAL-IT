	<p style="background-color:violet;color:Green">Big Sur is a rugged and mountainous section of the Central Coast of California between Carmel Highlands and San Simeon, where the Santa Lucia Mountains rise abruptly from the Pacific Ocean. It is frequently praised for its dramatic scenery. Big Sur has been called the "longest and most scenic stretch of undeveloped coastline in the contiguous United States",[1] a sublime "national treasure that demands extraordinary procedures to protect it from development",[2] and "one of the most beautiful coastlines anywhere in the world, an isolated stretch of road, mythic in reputation".[3] The stunning views, redwood forests, hiking, beaches, and other recreational opportunities have made Big Sur a popular destination for about 7 million people who live within a day's drive and visitors from across the world. It is among the top 35 tourist destinations world-wide.</p>
